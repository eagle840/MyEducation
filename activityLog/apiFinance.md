A email from postman for a covid vs stocks: https://www.twitch.tv/getpostman/video/600403515  
Had trouble 'with API tests' in that video.  
The follow was useful   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlvbc6kIBOk  
But only part 1 of 3 video, it runs javascript in the API test.  
! remember to use your console.log to TS  
used postname inbuilt JS (in sandbox?) to generate x3 datasets, covid case, x2 stocks


Notes on API tests (postman)  
pm.<fuction>   ?pm = postman module?  
Uses callbacks (reminder on JS callbacks  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxyFlXbhdsY)   
At 50 minutes in there was a change over to use chart.js  chartjs.org (opensource?)   
  They used chartjs with in postname to generate charts.  
  
 CONSIDERATIONS:   push this data to supersets?
