# Ways to accerelate learning

## How to read a book and take the information in.
* review chapters in book.
8 review sections titles in chapter to see things covered in that chapter
1. flip through each page in a chapter
2. At the end of chatper - read through the quiz if there is one
3. Read all bold print (in a chatper)
4. Read 1st and last in a paragraph
* read chapter

## How to speed read videos (from above section)
  * I was thinking it was possible to take the information from the above section and apply it to video learning
  1. Read all the video titles
  2. skim through the video looking at slides
  2a. is there a section quiz to take? can I youtube search '<subject> test questions'
  3. speed watch the videos
  4. test, noting failures
  5. regular watch test failure subjects
 
## 'Subject Linking@

* Need a better title for this section
* Using linked-data to get an over view of a subject
* find a wikipedia article for the subject, they may be a grid at this bottom that gives an over view
* you can also jump over to the wikidata site for that subject (Q value)

## Note Taking
OneNote, a blog, documentation system (eg git)
I'll use  paper to write out over all ideas/systems, and then write them into the computer and the end of 'class'
Use different coloured pens to break up the page.
Keep a record of the classes/video/reading you've done.
Consider usin flash cards for the hard to rememeber items
Consider writing your own and a exam sheet. I'll create a excel sheet with questions and anwsers and save two versions, one without the answers that I can print off.
Consider writing a blog and producing a 'product' to show/explain to other how it works. 


Note that I've tried othere college solutions - seems to take to much paper with no results

Run throuh class taking notes in BLUE
Run through again, using RED/GREEN to clearly mark out sections, order notes, enter things into flash cards that you didn't remember


## Class/course taking
if there are many sections in a course, consider taking all the sub courses over time as opposed to taking one at a time
If it's a short course that can be completed in a day, consider spreading it out over a few days, you'll retain the information better.
This will get you education each day in a subsection, that will help reenforce the education over time
Also have flash cards ready to fill in
