# Ways to accerelate learning

## How to read a book and take the information in.
* review chapters in book.
8 review sections titles in chapter to see things covered in that chapter
1. flip through each page in a chapter
2. At the end of chatper - read through the quiz if there is one
3. Read all bold print (in a chatper)
4. Read 1st and last in a paragraph
* read chapter

## How to speed read videos (from above section)
  * I was thinking it was possible to take the information from the above section and apply it to video learning
  1. Read all the video titles
  2. skim through the video looking at slides
  2a. is there a section quiz to take? can I youtube search '<subject> test questions'
  3. speed watch the videos
  4. test, noting failures
  5. regular watch test failure subjects

## Note Taking

Note that I've tried othere college solutions - seems to take to much paper with no results

Run throuh class taking notes in BLUE
Run through again, using RED/GREEN to clearly mark out sections, order notes, enter things into flash cards that you didn't remember


## Class/course taking
if there are many sections in a course, consider takeing all the sub courses over time as opposed to taking one at a time
This will get you education each day in a subsection, that will help reenforce the education over time
Also have flash cards ready to fill in
